# Program Description

This assignment is about the chomp game.  
The game has two modes, Player vs. Player and Player vs. AI.  
The AI mode uses the minimax algorithm to decide the moves of the AI.  
The poisonous chocolate bar is indicated with a `#` symbol on the print statements and as a `-1` in the code. The non-eaten chocolates are indicated with `1` and the eaten chocolates are indicated with `0`.  
Players can choose the size of the chocolate bar and the starting player.  
The game ends when the poisonous chocolate is eaten.
